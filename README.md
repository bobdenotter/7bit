silex-bootstrap
===============

My own [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) skeleton application, useful 
for quickly setting up a new Silex project.

Installation: 

Create a new folder, and clone from github. Then use composer to get the Silex micro-framework and components:

    git clone git://github.com/bobdenotter/silex-bootstrap.git silex-bootstrap
    cd silex-bootstrap
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

And you're good to go.
